# Foundations Projects:

### All Foundations Projects | The Odin Project | Foundations

This repository will include links to all projects of the "Foundations" course within "The Odin Project".

This repository was created after I completed the "Foundations" course, and its main goal is to give easy access to all projects done during the course and a short summary of what the projects include. [^1]

Please take note of each project's commit history; it is possible additional features *(not in the scope of the original project)* were added to a certain project; you can use the commit history *(and the "README" file within each repository)* to determine whether additional features *(that weren't a part of the original project)* were added to a project.

### Projects Included:

- ["Odin Recipes"](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/odin_recipes) - The first project I created, a very basic recipes website.

- ["Landing Page"](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/odin_landing) - The second project, aimed at implementing a page given a design.

- ["Rock Paper Scissors"](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/rps_project) - The third project, a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that utilizes JavaScript.

- ["Etch-a-Sketch"](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/eas_project) - The forth project, an "Etch-a-Sketch" like page that allows you to draw on a canvas.

- ["Calculator"](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/calc_project) - The final project of the "Foundations" course, a simple calculator.

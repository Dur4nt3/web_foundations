# Foundations Projects:

### Foundations | The Odin Project | All Projects

This repository will include all projects of the "Foundations" course within "The Odin Project".

This repository was created after I completed the "Foundations" course, and its main goal is grouping all the projects I've worked on during said course. [^1]

### Projects Included:

- "Odin Recipes" - The first project I created, a very basic recipes website.

- "Landing Page" - The second project, aimed at implementing a page given a design.

- "Rock Paper Scissors" - The third project, a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that utilizes JavaScript.

- "Etch-a-Sketch" - The forth project, an "Etch-a-Sketch" like page that allows you to draw on a canvas.

- "Calculator" - The final project of the "Foundations" course, a simple calculator.

[^1]: *It should be mentioned that the projects are not "retired", meaning, I will still work on them and improve them when I learn new concepts, the transfer was done solely for convenience.*
